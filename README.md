One of the critical factors behind the rapid spread of COVID-19 pandemic is a lengthy clinical testing time. The imaging tool, such as Chest X-ray (CXR), can speed up the identification process. Therefore, our objective is to develop an automated CAD system for the detection of COVID-19 samples from healthy and pneumonia cases using CXR images.

## Background and Benefits üòÉ
 - Due to the rapid spread of COVID-19 around the world, the number of COVID-19 cases continues to increase
 - Lots of countries are facing tremendous pressure on both public and medical resources
 - Although RT-PCR is the most widely used detection technology with COVID-19 detection, it still has some limitations.
 - High cost, being time-consuming, and having low sensitivity
